Online reviews have become an important source of information for users before making an informed purchase decision.
Early reviews of a product tend to have a high impact on the subsequent product sales. In this project, the initiative is taken to study the
behavior characteristics of early reviewers through their posted reviews on two real-world large e-commerce platforms, i.e., Amazon
and Yelp. 
</p>
    <p style ="text-align :justify ;">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In specific, the lifetime of product is divided into three consecutive stages, namely early, majority and laggards. A user who has
posted a review in the early stage is considered as an early reviewer. It is quantitatively characterize early reviewers based on their
rating behaviors, the helpfulness scores received from others and the correlation of their reviews with product popularity. 
</p>
    <p style ="text-align :justify ;">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
found that (1) an early reviewer tends to assign a higher average rating score; and (2) an early reviewer tends to post more helpful
reviews. The analysis of product reviews also indicates that early reviewers&#8217; ratings and their received helpfulness scores are likely to
influence product popularity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By viewing review posting process as a multiplayer competition game, by proposing a novel margin-based
embedding model for early reviewer prediction. Extensive experiments on two different e-commerce datasets have shown that our
proposed approach outperforms a number of competitive baselines
